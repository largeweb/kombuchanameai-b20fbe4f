Project Name: KombuchaNameAI

Description: A fun, simple web application where users upload images of their kombucha, and AI generates creative soda-style names based on the image's visual characteristics.

Features:

*   Image Upload: Users can upload images of their kombucha creations.
*   AI-Powered Name Generation: AI analyzes the image (colors, visible ingredients, overall aesthetic) and generates a unique, quirky soda-style name.
*   "Like" Button: Users can "like" the generated names they find appealing.

Target Audience: Kombucha enthusiasts, home brewers, anyone who enjoys creative AI applications and quirky name generation.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application (UI, image uploads, user accounts).
*   API for image analysis (e.g., Google Cloud Vision API, Clarifai).
*   API for AI-powered name generation (custom-trained model or a general-purpose language model fine-tuned for soda/kombucha names).
